# Python Flask Examples
I use [Python Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) in my day to day work. I build small microservices type of applications for different domains/clients using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). This repo contains some of my work and can be useful for developers who are just getting started with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

1. [hello_word](https://github.com/saisyam/python-flask-examples/tree/master/hello_world) - Simple "Hello! World" example to get an idea on how Flask application is structured. To execute this app we have to:
    ```bash
    $ export FLASK_APP=helloworld.py
    $ flask run
    ```
