# Python Flask Examples
I use [Python Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) in my day to day work. I build small microservices type of applications for different domains/clients using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). This repo contains some of my work and can be useful for developers who are just getting started with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).
